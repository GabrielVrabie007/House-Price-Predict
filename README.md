## Overview

House Price Prediction AI analyzes various property features such as location, area, number of rooms, and amenities to predict market values. The project includes data preprocessing,handling outliers, feature engineering, model training. üìä

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploration and visualization of housing data üìà
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced preprocessing and feature creation for better predictions üîß
- **Best model in this case**: Implementation of XGBoost algorithm

- **Price Insights**: Detailed analysis of factors influencing house prices üí°
